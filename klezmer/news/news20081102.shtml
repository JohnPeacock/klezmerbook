I recently upgraded to the latest version of Lilypond.  This resulted in a significant change in the layouts of some of the music.
I have now finished cleaning up all of the problems caused by that change.  Anything you download now should have a reasonable
distribution across pages.

I just added <a href="#ikh_bin_a_kleyner_dreydl">Ikh Bin a Kleyner Dreydl</a>.  I hope to have more Hanukah songs up soon.
