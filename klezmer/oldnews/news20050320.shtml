<p>
Made part of the clarinet melody in section C of
<a href="index.html#Nakht_in_Gan_Eden">Nakht in Gan Eydn</a> be scored in 2 octaves.
I've removed the 8va indication for that section.

<p>
As per notes from the last rehearsal.  Fixed problems in
<a href="index.html#Baym_Rebn">Baym Rebn in Palestina</a> where some notes were missing
accidentals in measure 14.
