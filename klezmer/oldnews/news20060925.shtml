I upgraded LilyPond to the latest stable version.  As a result a complete rebuild was done.
In theory everything should be the same as previous.  However, there might be small differences in the output.

I added 2 new songs at the request of Agnes FÃ¡zold.  They are still works in progress.  I haven't added the bass lines yet, let alone other harmony or counterpoint parts.
