<p>
We were really approaching <a href="#SidsFreylekhs">Sid's Freylekhs</a>
incorrectly.  It should have been played A,A,B,B,C,C2,A,B,C3.
However, the markup didn't really reflect that.  It is now fixed.
I also made the clarinet and trumpet have melody and tenor.

Because we have a trombonist again, I took the baritone out of the
trumpet score for <a href="#OdessaBulgar">Odessa Bulgar</a> and put in the
tenor part instead.
