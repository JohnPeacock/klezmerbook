<p>
Yesterday's update had 2 problems:
</p>
<ol>
<li>The alto sax part had the chords in C instead of E&#9837;</li>
<li>The clarinet part had not been updated with the chords</li>
</ol>
<p>
Both of these have been corrected.
</p>
<p>
The trumpet and violin will probably not be dealt with until next week.
